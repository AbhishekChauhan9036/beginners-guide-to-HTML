    <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the <u>meaning and structure of web content</u>. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation <mark>(CSS)</mark> or functionality/behavior <mark>(JavaScript)</mark>.</p>

    <p><del>"HyperText"</del> refers to links that connect <em>web pages to one another</em>, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

    <p>An <small>HTML element</small> is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".</p>
