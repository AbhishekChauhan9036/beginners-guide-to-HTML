    <h1>Document Outline</h1>

    <h2>What are document outlines?</h2>
    The document outline is the structure of a document, generated by the document’s headings, form titles, table titles, and any other appropriate landmarks to map out the document. The user agent can apply this information to generate a table of contents, for example. This table of contents could then be used by assistive technology to help the user, or be parsed by a machine like a search engine to improve search results. The outlining algorithm has been clearly defined in the HTML5 spec, so once all browsers and assistive technologies play ball, there will be some major accessibility wins (more on support later). Before we take a look at how this new algorithm works, it’s time for a quick walk down memory lane.

    <h2>Outlines in HTML4</h2>
    Creating document outlines prior to HTML5 was simple. You had six heading elements, &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;. Lower-numbered headings were of a higher rank of higher-numbered ones — i.e. &lt;h1&gt; was ranked higher than &lt;h2&gt;:
    
    <h3> outline </h3>
    <h3> outline </h3>
    
    <h4> outline </h4>
